## 🚗 About the App

**TaaDa was born from a simple observation:** there is no reliable way to use Android Auto in a Tesla without an external device, which is often expensive and complicated to use.

TaaDa’s goal is simple: to **offer an accessible, practical, and evolving alternative**, designed from the start to meet real user needs.

With **TaaDa**, you can:

- project Android Auto into your Tesla via the built-in browser,
- enjoy a streamlined experience without extra hardware,
- benefit from updates based on real user feedback.
